# Minic Standard Library

The Minic Standard Library will consist of a single function: `print`. More will likely be added later. Standard input, for one, is a glaring omission that will probably be addressed.

# Print

Prints an expression's value.

Example:
```c
int main() {
  print("Hello, world!");
}
```
